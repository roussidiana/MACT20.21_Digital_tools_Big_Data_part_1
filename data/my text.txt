collected from patients can help a doctor diagnose and treat an individual patient. After that, it can be anonymized and fed into machine learning systems to generate broader insights that can benefit many, many more.

Treating data like oil – using it once then assuming its usefulness has been depleted and disposing of it – would certainly be a mistake.

As the world’s oil reserves dwindle, extracting it becomes increasingly difficult and expensive. Conversely, data is becoming increasingly available as computer technology advances, more of our business and leisure activity moves online, and sensors become more sophisticated.

Data – particularly Big Data – also has far more variety than oil. The crude oil which is drilled from the ground is processed in a variety of ways into many different products of course, but in its raw state, it is all the same. Data can represent words, pictures, sounds, ideas, facts, measurements, statistics or anything else which can be processed by computers into strings of 1s and 0s that make up digital information.

Of course, data, like oil is a source of power. And those who control it (think of Amazon, Alibaba, Facebook or Google) are establishing themselves as masters of the universe, just as oil barons did 100 years ago. This has even led some to suggest that the data-mining giants have a responsibility to ensure that their resources are put to work for the benefit of humanity as a whole, rather than simply being allowed to enrich themselves. Unlike oil drilling, however, data mining does not intrinsically involve causing damage to the natural environment and exploitation of finite natural resources (apart from the electricity used to run the system).

Unregulated data-mining causes a whole different set of problems – privacy issues as well as the imbalance of power which is caused by information being in the hands of the few, rather than the many. Treating or thinking about data like oil only serves to encourage thi
